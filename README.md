# Bark

See it live here: [Bark](https://bark-liart.vercel.app/)

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Overview

Bark is a twitter clone with limited functionality. So far visitors are able to sign in with authentication through Discord or GitHub. Once signed in users are able to create posts!

My main goal was to learn how to create an app from scratch and deploy it to a production ready state. I was excited to learn a completely new tech stack, as I have limited experience with both frontend and backend development. 

I learned a lot about integrating different technologies, different load states, and authentication methods. 

Here are the different technologies used:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
